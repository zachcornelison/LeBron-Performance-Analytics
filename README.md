# LeBron-Performance-Analytics
A statistical analysis of LeBron’s in-game performance when playing high, low, and average minutes per game. 

This repository includes all data files, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau files, html file, and a write-up report (pdf) for the entire project.

This project serves as  basic exploratory data analysis of  LeBron James’ game performance  as it relates to his minutes played. The main question I am seeking to answer is, “Does LeBron play better or worse when he plays more minutes?” Through data collection and analysis of advanced statistics from multiple sources, I used analytics and visualizations to find an answer. A personal goal of this project was to demonstrate newly learned skills of Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.
