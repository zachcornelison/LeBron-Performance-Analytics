# LeBron-Performance-Analytics
A statistical analysis of LeBron’s in-game performance when playing high, low, and average minutes per game. 

This project serves as  basic exploratory data analysis of  LeBron James’ game performance  as it relates to his minutes played. The main question I am seeking to answer is, “Does LeBron play better or worse when he plays more minutes?” Through data collection and analysis of advanced statistics from multiple sources, I used analytics and visualizations to find an answer. A personal goal of this project was to demonstrate newly learned skills of Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.
